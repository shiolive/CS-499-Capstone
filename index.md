### Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

This artifact is a weight tracking application created in Android Studio utilizing Java for the base, XML for the UI, and SQLite for the database. It is an android application that allows a user to log their weight to track their weight over time, set a goal, receive notifications, and view their data in multiple ways. It was originally created in October 2024 for the SNHU CS-360 Mobile Architecture course. I selected this item because it is a full stack mobile application that I will be able to make significant improvements on and will be able to show my software engineering and design skills comprehensively.  

The main area that I chose to focus on to showcase my skills was the main activity of the application. In the main activity, the user has the option to add their weight and the date, and it displays the weight history in a grid format. This part of the application needed many improvements to make it more user-friendly and helpful. I swapped out the grid display of the weight history for a graph display which makes the data easier to view at a glance. I also made the date field auto generate for the current date so that the user doesn't have to enter the date themselves. This also allowed me to have better data so the graph could function properly. I moved the grid format to a separate page and added a button so the user could go view that information if they would like to. The final improvement I made was to create a check against the userâ€™s goal weight each time they enter an updated weight. If they met or surpassed their goal, the app displays a congratulatory message letting them know that they reached their goal.  

The process of improving this application ended up being much more difficult than I anticipated. The biggest challenge was getting the graph set up. The resources that I could find online to educate myself on the GraphView library were limited. The primary challenge with setting up the graph was being able to have the X axis be dates and have them populate correctly with the corresponding data. It required me to rethink how a significant portion of my main activity and database operated and ended up requiring me to rebuild a significant portion of the way that it worked. I ended up finding it necessary to populate the date for the user which required me to also adjust how records were added to the database. Overall, with the research I was able to find and trying different techniques and troubleshooting them until I found what worked for my project, I was able to overcome this challenge and my application ended up better for it.

### Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

This artifact is a JUnit test case on a CRUD Java application that interacts with a contact, appointment, and task creation system and validates the data entered and tests each function. It was originally created in April 2024 for CS-320 Software Testing course at SNHU. I included this in my portfolio because properly testing software is a vital part of any application and I believe it is an important skill. When I originally did this project in particular, I did not fully understand JUnit tests or the logic of software testing as a whole. Therefore, this project needed many revisions and was a great place for me to better my skills in building software tests. 

My plan was to increase the complexity of the application itself as well as the tests. I also planned to increase the coverage and fill the gaps in the tests to ensure that the application was well rounded and thoroughly tested. To complete this, I reviewed each java class alongside the associated test classes and identified numerous logic errors and gaps in the testing. A common error that I found were that I created the tests to test for successes in adding and updating the data, but I did not test to see if there were failures. By correcting this gap in logic, I was able to identify issues in the application structure itself as well. I corrected all of these errors and rewrote all of the tests for the program to make them more complex and more thorough. My coverage overall went from 78.6% to 92.7% with significant increases in coverage in the individual Java classes.
